## What is it about?

The classic hand game, but it's you against your computer (or you, versus this code).

## Why I made this?

It's based on a tutorial by [Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q).

I made my own version, with mobile design and other drawings.

:seedling: It helped me to practice my CSS skills and improve my javascript writing.
